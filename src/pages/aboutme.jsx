        <h2>Goals with my projects:</h2>
        <li>With most of my projects i like to take my time and learn what is happening behind the scenes of my projects,
             due to this i will mostly use c++ or C in my programming journey</li>
             <p></p>
        <li>With all my projects i will always try break down everything i write int he coding project, 
            Not only to renforce my learning but also so i can look back on it in the future,
            and probably laugh at how bad i wrote it but hey i like to keep track of my progress.

            By the end of 3 months from now starting at 0/1/03/2025 i want to have read most of the books im currently reading and show i have learned from them,
            To do this i will be creating alot of repos on my GitHub, This is a way for me to track my progress and also to motivate myself.
